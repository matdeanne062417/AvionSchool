      <h1 id="title">What are Scallops?</h1>
      <p>Scallops are a type of bivalve mollusk, 
          meaning the interior muscle is surrounded by two shells similarly to oysters,
        mussels, and clams. Inside the shell, scallops have a white adductor muscle (the part we to eat) 
        that opens and closes the shell, as well as a bright orange section called the coral. 
        The muscle is round and tender when cooked, with both a touch of sweetness and briny saltiness.
         The coral is also edible, but is not typically consumed in the U.S. There are two types of scallops: 
         Bay scallops and sea scallops. The bay variety are smaller (about the size of a dime) and more tender,
          while sea scallops are larger, growing as big as two inches.</p>
